Code you need to look at:

var/ -- implementation of "temp"oraries/names, used to implement variables and labels.
        the only file you should need to look at is temp.sig
        the modules Label and Variable have signature TEMP

labT/ -- abstract syntax of Godel's T with labeled sums and prodcts
         the only file you should need to look at is labt.sig

sem/ -- implementation of the static and dynamic semantics
        your work goes in typechecker.sml and dynamics.sml
        these implement the signatures in the corresponding .sig files

cmlib/ -- general SML library
          see Dict.sig and Set.sig for dictionary and set operations


Library code (no need to read): 

parser/ -- parsing strings into abstract syntax trees
bind/   -- converting ASTs to ABTs
top/ -- utilites for making the interactive top level and test harness
